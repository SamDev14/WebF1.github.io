      <h2 class="title">Week 2 - Week 16</h2>
        <h4>Week 2 - Information Security &amp; Unit Prep</h4>
          <p>I was first given an introduction to the unit. I was then told about my VM. We then worked in pairs to complete Website Awards worksheet. The practical ended with advice on good habits to build up.

        <h4>Week 3 - Web Security</h4>
          <p>This week we looked at some aspects of web security but the main focus was social engineering. This meant looking at ways people can gain information about others, purely using social techniques either in person or over the internet.
            For the practical I had to come up with a strategy that a yet-to-be-created social media site could use to keep user information secure. To do this I Identified the information most people share on a daily basis. I then looked at how this information could be captured and used in a system. I then categorised that information. Finally I defined how this information can be processed and classified on various platforms e.g social media. With this information a company would be able to implement the necessary protocols to keep information safe.

        <h4>Week 4 - Reviewing Literature</h4>
          <p>This week were introduced to our first piece of coursework for the unit which was a literature review. We were told the topic we would be covering and given a few tasks that would help us with our research. We were asked to list search terms we could use to find suitable material to review. This was important as we are reviewing academic literature, not just regular magazine articles etc. We were also advised to make structured notes as this will make things easier for us.

        <h4>Week 5 - Academic Writing</h4>
          <p>I learned about the benefits of replacing phrasal verbs. I looked at the importance of grammar. I learned about the importance of avoiding personal and subjective writing when writing a literature review. The lesson ended by revising some of our previous assignments to see if we could improve the quality of grammar with these techniques. This week not only taught me some good techniques for academic writing but also ways to critique myself in order to improve.

        <h4>Week 6 - Introduction to Markup</h4>
          <p>I created a simple web page using HTML. I then uploaded it to the VM. I learned how to use the web server. I was told about the Mozilla Developer Network.
            Having done a lot of HTML previously this wasn’t very new to me but it was a nice refresher week.

        <h4>Week 7 - Reading Week</h4>

        <h4>Week 8 - Separating Form and Content</h4>
          <p>I was introduced to CSS. I was shown the basics of the language. Again this wasn’t new to me but still very relevant and I was happy to finally be coding in this unit.

        <h4>Week 9 - Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h4>
          <p>I used Atom and looked at ways to make it more efficient in order to increase productivity. I had already been using Atom but this practical introduced me to some packages I wasn’t aware of that will improve my workflow with the editor.

        <h4>Week 10 - Design</h4>
          <p>In groups we arranged cards into categories to create a mockup of a navigation bar for a hotel. Each card represented a facility or activity provided by the hotel. After we had arranged everything, we had to explain our thought process to our practical tutors for feedback.

        <h4>Week 11 - Using Images</h4>
          <p>I experimented with images in HTML and CSS. I was shown how to add images and manipulate them. I learned how to display different images depending on the size of the browser window which was something I hadn’t done before.

        <h4>Week 12 - Website Marking Scheme</h4>
          <p>I looked at the Website Marking Scheme. I learned what needs to be included in my website. I was disappointed that there wasn’t more marks awarded for design as I feel it is an integral part of a good website, however I was happy with the rest of it which gave me confidence going into this piece of coursework.

        <h4>Week 13 - Addressing the Web</h4>
          <p>I listed my favourite links using the correct HTML tags. I then created 3 new HTML files and added links to them in the original HTML file. We were shown how to correctly name links and sort them in folders.

        <h4>Week 14 - Usability</h4>
          <p>I sketched the layout for my site. I then reviewed the usability standards. I looked at media queries in CSS which was interesting. Finally I looked at Web Patterns and how they help inform design. This practical was good as it taught me good practices for creating a user friendly site, giving me ideas of how to improve my own website.

        <h4>Week 15 - Accessibility</h4>
          <p>Working in small groups, one of us simulated a handicap of some sort and the other helped them navigate the web. This allowed me to gain an understanding in making my site accessible to everyone. This was something I had not considered before and it showed me the importance of using certain techniques in CSS, such as em instead of px as this allows text to resize according to browser setup.

        <h4>Week 16 - Scalable Graphics on the Web</h4>
          <p>I used Inkscape for the first time to create a simple SVG. I then wrote an SVG using code in Atom. I didn’t really enjoy Inkscape and preferred writing the code instead. I felt this gave me more control and I could build an image based on logic and maths rather than just skill with a certain program.
