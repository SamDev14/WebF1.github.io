        <h4>Week 3 - Web Security</h4>
          <p>I Identified  the information most people share on a daily basis. I then looked at how this information could be captured and used in a system. I then categorised that information. Finally I defined how this information can be processed and classified on various platforms e.g social media.

        <h4>Week 4 - Reviewing Literature</h4>
          <p>I listed search terms for finding literature to review. I was advised about note taking.

          <p>I learned about the benefits of replacing phrasal verbs. I looked at the importance of grammar. I learned about the importance of avoiding personal and subjective writing when writing a literature review. The lesson ended by revising some of our previous assignments to see if we could improve the quality of grammar with these techniques.

        <h4>Week 6 - Introduction to Markup</h4>
          <p>I created a simple web page using HTML. I then uploaded it to the VM. I learned how to use the web server. I was told about the Mozilla Developer Network.

        <h4>Week 7 - Reading Week</h4>

        <h4>Week 8 - Separating Form and Content</h4>
          <p>I was introduced to CSS. I was shown the basics of the language.

        <h4>Week 9 - Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h4>
          <p>I used Atom and looked at ways to make it more efficient in order to increase productivity.

        <h4>Week 10 - Design</h4>
          <p>In groups we arranged cards into categories to create a mockup of a navigation bar for a hotel. Each card represented a facility or activity provided by the hotel.

        <h4>Week 11 - Using Images</h4>
          <p>I experimented with images in HTML and CSS. I was shown how to add images and manipulate them.

        <h4>Week 12 - Website Marking Scheme</h4>
          <p>I looked at the Website Marking Scheme. I learned what needs to be included in my website.

        <h4>Week 13 - Addressing the Web</h4>
          <p>I listed my favourite links using the correct HTML tags. I then created 3 new HTML files and added links to them in the original HTML file.

        <h4>Week 14 - Usability</h4>
          <p>I sketched the layout for my site. I then reviewed the usability standards. I looked at media queries in CSS. Finally I looked at Web Patterns and how they help inform design.

        <h4>Week 15 - Accessibility</h4>
          <p>Working in small groups, one of us simulated a handicap of some sort and the other helped them navigate the web. This allowed me to gain an understanding in making my site accessible to everyone.
