      <article>
        <p>Social engineering is the practice of using various strategies and tactics to obtain sensitive information from others. One of the most common methods is called Phishing. This is the practice of sending emails, texts or making calls to various people pretending to be someone else. The sender of the email does so with the intention of obtaining sensitive information or gaining access to a computer system. “Successful phishing can not only result in the attacker gaining password and    login information, but also complete ownership of computer systems through attacks using software vulnerabilities” (Holm et al. 2013).
          Technology progresses so fast that a lot of people simply find it difficult to keep up and this makes them vulnerable, especially when it comes to the web. It is especially important that companies give their employees sufficient training in this area to reduce the risk of a successful phishing attack on the company.

        <p>“Phishing environments, techniques and countermeasures: A survey” is a paper by Ahmed Aleroud and Lina Zhou. It identifies an area that has allowed phishing attacks to increase significantly, and states that phishing attacks increased by 51% in the first quarter of 2015.
          This area is social media. In the past ten years social media has revolutionised the way many of us communicate with each other but this has also made it a great tool for criminals.
          Although the paper explains what social engineering is and how attackers use these techniques it doesn’t talk about another huge issue with security on social media. People tend to give away too much information on their profiles and then make it public for anyone to see. Companies should be concerned about this as an employee giving away their job title and place of work could potentially make them a target of a phishing attack.
          Another point it talks about is the process of a phishing attack and it breaks it down into three steps. These are “Attack Preperation”, “Attack Execution” and “Attack Results Exploitation” (Aleroud &amp; Zhou, 2017). Companies should be making their employees aware of this process in order to protect both the person and the company.

        <p>There are two components needed to carry out an effective phishing attack. These are the email or text and the website it redirects the user to. In the paper “Design and evaluation of the highly insidious extreme phishing attacks” (Zhao et al., 2017) this topic is mentioned but it goes on to state that phishing attacks can be split into three categories, simple, advanced and extreme. What group a phishing attack falls into is decided by how legitimate the website looks. The paper   provides a great amount of detail on this topic and brings up many points that companies should be sharing with their employees. Showing them examples in each category is a simple, cost effective way to decrease the number of phishing attacks they receive. It will also make them more wary in general when checking their emails and browsing the web.

        <p>For a hacker targeting a company, the easiest way to hack them is to send an email pretending to be someone else such as a person in management. They will usually do a lot of background research first and use social engineering to improve their chances of success. They then construct fake emails and send them to the person or people they are targeting. These emails usually contain a link to a website which is then used to obtain details from the user. In “The State of Phishing Attacks” the author states that “while an average phishing site lasts an average of 62 hours before being taken down, sites using fast flux tend to last an average of 196 hours” (Aaron G, 2010). He also explains that although this is true, hackers plan their attacks carefully and can pressure a person to access the site while their boss is out of hours. This means that time constraints are less of an issue to a hacker. A lot of people wouldn’t question an urgent email from their boss in that situation and this only increases the possibility of success. These statistics aren’t necessarily accurate though as  another paper states “It can be seen that 158,544 phishing websites were functional even in Quarter 4 of 2015” (Varshney et al. 2016). This suggests certain sites can remain active for a lot longer.

        <p>“Training to Mitigate Phishing Attacks Using Mindfulness Techniques” talks about a different approach some companies are taking to deal with phishing. Mindfulness training is now being used to teach people how to protect themselves from attackers. The paper argues that other methods do well to combat certain aspects of phishing but they do not provide the dynamic awareness needed to adapt to new types of phishing attacks. This brings up an interesting point that hasn’t been mentioned in the other papers. We need to know the signs of a phishing attack regardless of the tools being used.
          The paper also mentions the three main ways companies deal with phishing attacks; “(1) automated removal or quarantine of phishing messages and corresponding websites; (2) automated warning mechanisms that notify individuals when they encounter a suspicious message or website; and (3) behavioral training during which individuals are taught to identify and report attacks”. (Jensen, Dinger, Wright, & Thatcher, 2017). Even using a combination of all three doesn’t guarantee safety from a phishing attack but with mindfulness people are able to see past the deception.

        <p>Although many points have been addressed about phishing and social engineering, hackers are still one step ahead of a lot of companies. New methods will be introduced over time to combat the hackers, however as technology becomes ever more dependant on the internet, the options available for hackers only increases.
          The key might be to focus on the social aspects rather than the digital. Teaching employees to recognise an attempted phishing attack will always be more effective than any software a company has at their disposal. The reason for this is simple. Phishing attacks target people, not the system itself.
